This will be the repository for our CG-2 work.
Here are some instructions to get started. Feel free to expand on what I wrote here if needed.

# Installation Requirements (Write me a mail/Whatsapp)
1. Get [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/index.html)
  * This will be useful for dealing with creating windows and OpenGL contexts
2. Make sure you also have an updated version of clang installed that supports c++17 features
  * You can check your version of clang with `clang --version`

# Running the project
1. Simply run the Makefile by typing `make` while in the root directory.
  * This should compile a binary called `cg2` which you can execute from the command line,
    which displays a single triangle with some colors
2. If there are any errors with the project please let me know
