This will be the repository for our CG-2 work.
Here are some instructions to get started. Feel free to expand on what I wrote here if needed.

In order to build the project make sure you have Qt5, CMake GLUT and GLM installed.  
Then to build follow these steps while in the root directory:  
  
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The resulting binary should then be found in the build directory `minqgl/src` with the name `cg2`
